General Notes

### ESP8266 Wifi Module ###

I'm using the ESP-01 module, the original.

When connected to Arduino IDE Serial Monitor:

  1 -- baud rate must be set to 115200
  2 -- Also select "Both NL & CR"

Test connection by sending "AT", response should be "OK"

Commands sent to ESP-01 are case-sensitive, must be all caps.

Commands :

  AT+CWMODE?    returns 1,2, or 3
  AT+CWMODE=2   sets mode to Access Point
  AT+CIFSR      checks for IP
  AT+CWJAP= “Wi-FiNetwork”,“Password”     connects to WiFi
  AT+CIPMUX=1   enable multiple connections
  AT+CIPSERVER=1,80   start server at port 80

CW Modes :

STA = 1   (Station)
AP = 2    (Access Point)
Both = 3

I've set mine to STA mode with AT+CWMODE=1

** Copying commands into the serial monitor doesn't work, you need to type it.

## Current Firmware Version :

  AT+GMR

  AT version:1.1.0.0(May 11 2016 18:09:56)
  SDK version:1.5.4(baaeaebb)
  compile time:May 20 2016 15:08:19
  OK

### LAST THING I DID :

  flashed the ESP8266 with an empty arduino sketch

### NEXT STEP:

  load up ESP8266WiFi.h and set up ESP01 as webserver
