=================================



Simple Arduino code to inform user if the axolotl's water temperature has gone out of the safe range.

Displays current temperature on connected LCD screen, as well as "too hot", "too cold", or "just right".

All hardware requirements are described in /docs/hardware.rst.

Note: The water sensor used does require wire stripping to install.
